# SCRUMptious
SCRUMptious is an app focused around discovering new recipes. This was created as part of a course to learn flutter and dart.

## Features:
- Clicking on a category takes you to a list of meals with a preview for each meal. This displays a picture with affordability, complexity and time descriptions/icons underneath.
- Clicking a meal brings the user to a more detailed description of the meal and the recipe which includes ingredients and a step by step guide
- When viewing a meal the user can add it to favourites with the favourite button in the top right. Giving the user easier access to this recipe from the 'splash' screen.
- Opening the side drawer from the categories page allows the user to apply filters such as: Vegetarian, Vegan, Lactose-Free and Gluten-Free. These options allow the user to view only suitable meals for these restrictions.
